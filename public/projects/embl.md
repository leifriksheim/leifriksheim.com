The Nordic EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine aims to address some of the biggest challenges in biomedicine today. They needed a new design and website to make it easier to share collaborators, publications and events.

Working closely together with Erling Aarones, we developed a lightweight website with a focus on making it easy for EMBL to maintain the content.
