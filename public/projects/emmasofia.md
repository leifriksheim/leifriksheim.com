While expanding their work, the communication outgrew EmmaSofia and ended up as being fragmented. They had to manage several different domains and technologies, with a webshop in one place, a website in another, and with manually registration of members and payments.

I made a new unified styleguide, new websites and integrated their existing shopify web shop into their new webpage. I also made a Node.js server to connect different microservices like PayPal and AirTable to make a new automatic member system.
