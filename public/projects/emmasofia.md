EmmaSofia is an political organization working for a drug policy reform in Norway,
based on evidence and respect for human rights.

Before the new websites, their communication was fragmented. They had a web shop selling testkits in one place, they had a website another place, and they did all the member registration manually.

The first part of the process involved making [a unifying design library](https://emmasofia-styleguide.netlify.com/) for the organization.
This way we could ensure that the organization had a similar look throughout different campaign sites. Also it would provide a UI-kit to other developers to be able to build pages quick.

Then came the webpage
